\section{Compiling and Running}
The project is built using GNU Autotools and thus can be built using
the standard configure make command sequence. The standard make target
will build the entire library including test cases.

The test cases are configured dynamically using the envirnomnet
variables SME\_SCHEDS, SME\_ITERATIOSN, SME\_PROCS amd SME\_THREADS
