\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Project description}
In this report, we describe the design and implementation of a highly
efficient library for parallel execution of SME networks.

In this report, we describe a synchronous message passing framework
intended to aid simulation of applications whose operating semantics
are compatible with the SME model

\section{Motivation}
Why is this awesome?

\section{Limitations}
This report will not discuss details related to design of hardware
