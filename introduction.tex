\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Project description}
In this report, we describe the design and implementation of a highly
efficient library for parallel execution of new, globally synchronous,
message passing framework called Synchronous Message Exchange
(SME). We will

In this report, we describe a synchronous message passing framework
intended to aid simulation of applications whose operating semantics
are compatible with the SME model

\section{Hardware Description Languages}
A Hardware Description Language (HDL) is a programming language for
describing hardware designs. A program written in such a language is
usually

\section{Background and Motivation}
Field-programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) provides several advantages over
using GPGPUS for processing work including a significantly improved
performance-per-watt ratio. Due to the low-level nature of current
tools for programming FPGAs, their use are largely restricted to
engineers with working knowledge in the field of hardware design. In
order for software developers to take advantage of FPGAs, improved
high-level hardware design utilities are required \cite{bacon2013fpga}.

The creation of SME was motivated by attempts to use CSP for modeling
hardware which, for simple cases, proved successful
\cite{rehr2013bpu}, but additional testing revealed that the CSP model
introduced a significant overhead when simulating more complicated
hardware designs. Modeling the clock-cycle driven global synchrony
that exists in hardware proved to be particularly difficult with CSP
and required the introduction of several additional processes and
channels. This added complexity reduced simulation performance and
limited the usefulness of the CSP-based hardware design model \cite{vinter2014synchronous}.

SME is an attempt to provide a programming framework that, while
leveraging and maintaining the properties of CSP that proved useful
and f enforcing a hardware-like paradigm, that is accessible to
software developers. By \cite{vinter2014synchronous}
