\chapter{Introduction}

In this report, we describe the design and implementation of a highly
efficient library for parallel execution of new, globally synchronous,
message passing framework called Synchronous Message Exchange
(SME). We will present a parallel, compiled framework, named
C++SME, which can be used to implement and execute applications
implementing the SME model.

The remainder of this chapter, will describe and define the SME
model. The second chapter will describe the process behind designing
C++SME. In the third chapter we will describe the implementation
process and finally, we will show the benchmarks performed of our
implementation. 


\section{Hardware Description Languages}
A Hardware Description Language (HDL) is a programming language for
describing hardware designs. A program written in such a language is
usually

\section{Background and Motivation}
Field-programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) provides several advantages over
using GPGPUS for processing work including a significantly improved
performance-per-watt ratio. Due to the low-level nature of current
tools for programming FPGAs, their use are largely restricted to
engineers with working knowledge in the field of hardware design. In
order for software developers to take advantage of FPGAs, improved
high-level hardware design utilities are required \cite{bacon2013fpga}.

The creation of SME was motivated by attempts to use CSP for modeling
hardware which, for simple cases, proved successful
\cite{rehr2013bpu}, but additional testing revealed that the CSP model
introduced a significant overhead when simulating more complicated
hardware designs. Modeling the clock-cycle driven global synchrony
that exists in hardware proved to be particularly difficult with CSP
and required the introduction of several additional processes and
channels. This added complexity reduced simulation performance and
limited the usefulness of the CSP-based hardware design model \cite{vinter2014synchronous}.

These attempts were performed as a part of a master thesis which,
despite acheiving their original goal found that the concurrency model
of CSP was directly at odds with simulating hardware. Since CSP is
based on the idea that any process can communicate at any time,
the addition of a large number of additional channels and processes
were needed in order to tame this behaviour. A central clock process
were needed in order to propagate a clock signal to all processes,
telling them when, and when not to, communicate. Furthermore, latch
processes had to be inserted in order to dimulyr 

SME is an attempt to provide a programming framework that, while
leveraging and maintaining the properties of CSP that proved useful
and f enforcing a hardware-like paradigm, that is accessible to
software developers. By \cite{vinter2014synchronous}

\section{Synchronous Message Exchange}
In this section, we elaborate on the description of SME from the
previous section. We will describe the 

We would like to start by defining the terms used henceforth in this
report to avoid any ambiguities. Many of the terms used, have a
specific meaning when used to describe computer hardware and this
meaning will generally give a good idea of the meaning of a term in
SME.


\subsection{Definitions}

\begin{description}
  \item{Network} A network is the highest level structure in the
    SME-model. It is simply a network of processes connected by buses
  \item{Cycle} During a cycle, all processes has executed and all
    busses has propagated their values. A cycle goes through two
    distinct phases which we will refer to as the process execution
    phase and the value propagation phase. The process execution phase
    will activate all the execution units in the network to allow them
    to perform data calculation. The value propagation phase will
    transfer the output-values generated by processes in the current
    cycle, to serve as input-values in the next cycle.
\end{description}


\subsection{Components}
Compared to CSP, a much smaller and simpler set of components are used
to model the process network. In this section, we describe those
c

\begin{description}
\item[Process] A process is an execution unit performing a unit of
  work. A process is defined by input and output busses used for
  communicating with other processes in the network and function which
  is called when the process is executed. The internal state of a
  process persistent between executions, but it's execution cannot
  have any side-effects. Thus, the only way the execution of a process
  can alter the state of other processes is by bus communication.
\item[Bus] A bus enables communication between processes and should be
  considered analogous to buses found in actual hardware. A bus
  consists of a writing-slot and a reading-slot, both of which can
  hold a signed integer value. A bus in SME implements the
  CSP-equivalent of a one-to-all channel with a one message
  overwrite-buffer which means that only the final value written to
  the writing-slot will persist in the next cycle. The value of the
  reading-slot, on the other hand, can be read by all connected
  processes during a cycle. The value of the reading-slot is
  idempotent and is guaranteed to remain constant during the process
  execution phase of a cycle. During the value-propagation phase of a
  cycle the value of the writing-slot is copied to the
  reading-slot. From the point of view of the processes, the
  value-propagation phase is atomic, meaning that the values of all
  buses can be observed changing ``at conce''. If no value is written
  the writing-slot of a bus during a cycle, the value of its
  writing-slot will be 0 in the subsequent cycle.

\end{description}

\subsection{Properties}
The SME model has a number of special properties which must be
maintained in order to ensure correct execution of the network. These
properties also influences the design of our execution model

%\begin{description}
%  \item[Clock cycles] One defining feature of
%    hardware is that all processing is driven by a clock beat. In
%    order to enable fulfillment of this goal we introduce a simulated
%    clock beat in our implementation of SME and thus the defining
%    property of hardware is preserved in the SME model.

%  \item[Global synchronicity] As a consequence of implementing the
%    simulated clock best, all events and communications of the
%    network occurs completely synchronous from the point of view of a
%    process. FIXME

%  \item[Shared nothing] A process is completely
%    autonomous and can only change state through receiving a message
%    on its incoming bus. A process is also self contained in the sense
%\end{description}

\begin{property}[Implicit clock] One defining feature of
    hardware is that all processing is driven by a clock beat. In
    order to enable fulfillment of this goal we introduce a simulated
    clock beat in our implementation of SME and thus the defining
    property of hardware is preserved in the SME model.
\end{property}

\begin{property}[Global synchrony]
  % http://eyes4earth.org/2014/11/synchronicity-or-synchrony/
  \label{synchro}
  As a consequence of implementing the simulated clock best, all
  events and communications of the network occurs completely
  synchronous from the point of view of a process. FIXME
\end{property}

\begin{property}[Shared Nothing]
  \label{noshare}
  A process is completely autonomous and can only change state through
  receiving a message on its incoming bus. A process is also self
  contained in the sense
